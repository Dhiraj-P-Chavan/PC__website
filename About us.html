            <h1>About Us.</h1>
            <p class="fs-4 fw-semibold">
                Pokémon, electronic game series from Nintendo that debuted in Japan in February 1996 as Pokémon Green
                and Pokémon Red. The franchise later became wildly popular in the United States and around the world.
                The series, originally produced for the companys Game Boy line of handheld consoles, was introduced in
                1998 to the United States with two titles, known to fans as Red and Blue. In the games, players assume
                the role of Pokémon trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing them to battle other Pokémon.
                Pokémon became one of the most successful video game franchises in the world, second only to Nintendos
                Super Mario Bros.,<br>
                The original Pokémon is a role-playing game based around building a small team of monsters to battle
                other monsters in a quest to become the best. Pokémon are divided into types, such as water and fire,
                each with different strengths. Battles between them can be likened to the simple hand game
                rock-paper-scissors. For example, to gain an advantage over a Pokémon that cannot beat an opponents
                Charizard character because of a weakness to fire, a player might substitute a water-based Pokémon. With
                experience, Pokémon grow stronger, gaining new abilities. By defeating Gym Leaders and obtaining Gym
                Badges, trainers garner acclaim.<br>
                Pikachu, a yellow mouselike creature, is the undisputed face of Pokémon and helped the series become a
                worldwide phenomenon. Pokémon inspired a cartoon series, movies, books, a toy line, sequels, spin-offs,
                a clothing line, and a popular trading-card game. In spite of a friendly interface and little violence,
                Pokémon has not been without controversy, however. In 1999 the parents of two nine-year-old boys sued
                Nintendo, stating that the Pokémon card game had caused the children to develop gambling problems and
                likening the trading-card craze to an illegal lottery. Religious groups that discount the theory of
                evolution also targeted Pokémon, for showing Pokémon evolving into new creatures.<br>
                Beginning in 2006, Pokémon video-game titles were <a class="navbar-brand" aria-current="page"
                    href="video.html">produced</a> exclusively for a new handheld console, the Nintendo DS, instead of
                the Game Boy, which was soon discontinued. In 2013 Pokémon X and Pokémon Y debuted on the Nintendo 3DS,
                which employed stereoscopic technology. The mobile application Pokémon GO was a blockbuster success upon
                its release in 2016. Developed by Niantic Labs, a former division of Google, the game used GPS data and
                the mobile devices camera to create an “augmented reality” that allowed users to capture Pokémon from
                real-life locations.<br>
                Pokémon, 20th- and 21st-century Japanese fantasy-based cartoon creatures that spawned a video- and
                card-game franchise.<br>
                In the Pokémon or “Pocket Monsters” video game series, players were able to explore the games fictional
                world by looking for wild Pokémon creatures to capture and tame. As Pokémon trainers, they readied the
                small monsters to compete in battle against other trainers Pokémon. Although fighting was a key aspect
                of the game and the creatures could be injured, none ever died; when defeated, they merely fainted.
